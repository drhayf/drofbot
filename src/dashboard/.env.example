# Drofbot Dashboard — Vite Environment Variables
# =============================================================================
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values.
# All variables must be prefixed with VITE_ to be accessible in the browser.
#
# In development, the Vite dev server proxies /api to the gateway (see vite.config.ts),
# so VITE_API_URL and VITE_WS_URL are typically not needed for local dev.
# Set them for production builds or non-standard setups.

# --- API URL (production builds, or if gateway is on a different host) ---
# VITE_API_URL=https://dashboard.yourdomain.com/api

# --- WebSocket URL (for direct gateway connection, if needed) ---
# VITE_WS_URL=ws://localhost:18789

# --- Supabase (direct client access from dashboard) ---
