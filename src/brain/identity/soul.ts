/**
 * Soul — Core Identity
 * Phase: 4
 * Purpose: The immutable core of Drofbot's identity. Stores fundamental
 *          values, voice characteristics, and the "who I am" that persists
 *          across all contexts and conversations. Loaded from workspace/SOUL.md
 *          and enriched through self-reflection.
 *
 * TODO: Implement in Phase 4. See DROFBOT-FORK-VISION.md for full spec.
