/**
 * Memory Promoter
 * Phase: 2
 * Purpose: Promotes important episodic memories to semantic memories based
 *          on frequency, recency, and impact scoring. Implements the
 *          "forgetting curve" — low-importance memories decay while
 *          important ones solidify.
 *
 * TODO: Implement in Phase 2. See DROFBOT-FORK-VISION.md for full spec.
