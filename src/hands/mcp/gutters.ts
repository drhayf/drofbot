/**
 * GUTTERS — MCP Integration
 * Phase: 5
 * Purpose: Model Context Protocol bridge that exposes Drofbot's capabilities
 *          as MCP tools and consumes external MCP servers. GUTTERS (General
 *          Unified Tool Transport for Extensible Runtime Services) is the
 *          extensibility layer that allows third-party tool integration.
 *
 * TODO: Implement in Phase 5. See DROFBOT-FORK-VISION.md for full spec.
